The proposed project aims toÂ **build a movie recommender system using Python, leveraging the TMDB API to fetch movie metadata from 1980 until 2023**. The TMDB (The Movie Database) is an online database that provides comprehensive information related to movies, TV shows, and other forms of visual media.

Movie recommendation systems have gained popularity in recent years due to the overwhelming number of movies available for viewers to choose from. The rise of streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime has made it difficult for viewers to decide which movie to watch. Thus, to address this issue, we have decided to develop a project that utilizes TMDB's API, which provides readily available movie metadata, as a solution for movie selection dilemmas.
